Chainbench attempts to provide meaningful comparisons of the *relative* performance
of different Java distributed locking frameworks, such as Hazelcast, Terracotta, etc.

Each iteration it randomly selects a framework from a specified list, along with other parameters.

By averaging over many such iterations (i.e. using multiple runs per data point), meaningful conclusions
can be drawn about the relative performance of these frameworks.
